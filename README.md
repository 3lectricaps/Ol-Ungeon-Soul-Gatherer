I do not know how git hub works just yet, so you'll have to deal with a shitty organisation, sorry about it.

This Project was made long ago when I didn't know a lot about python and coding in general.
But I love to look back on it now that I know pretty much anything about OOP (I think).
It's a discontinued text-based rogue-like with a weird name.
